This is a simple mod that reduces the damage taken by players and vehicles in Dayz, this should work on most vehicles, this is my first mod so there may be bugs please report them to me I'll try my best to fix them

There is a config file that will be created on first start that allows you to modify the values
```
{
    "dmgModifier": 0.8,  //This is the Damage Multiplier for the Vehicle Damage
    "plyrdmgModifier": 0.8, //This is the Damage Multiplier for the Player Damage
    "mindmg": 1350,  //This is the minimum damage that the vehicle has to take before taking any damage
    "subtractmindmg": 1 //This will subtract the minimum damage from the Vehicle before calculating the damage output
}
```
